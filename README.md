## What Is This?
This repo should serve as a paste-bin for things I do and such. I am using [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) together to create markdown and then convert it to html for the website. This process is being facilitated by the work of [Mara-Li](https://github.com/Mara-Li) who put together conversion scripts for popular features in Obsidian, as well as created a plugin for Obsidian that commits notes to GitHub repos. Via Github workflows, the website is automatically built, and files are placed in the proper directories. Below are the resources Mara-Li provides for using her repos. Big thanks to her!
