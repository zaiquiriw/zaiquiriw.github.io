Predictions from Data: We can train algorithms on a portion of the data, and test it on the remaining data. They can learn from data over time as well Accuracy: That\u2019s the rub, we have to be accurate to some baseline. If our data says 99%, then we want to beat a baseline of 99%. Actions: Autonomous agents, or things like smart thermostats or assistants, take actions based on what they have learned, the end goal of a lot of ML Machine Learning Scenarios \u00b6 Machine learning can be divided into into different classes Informative v. Active \u00b6 Informative algorithms are most algorithms looked at in this book. they input data observations and output a model of the data that can be used to predict outcomes for a new data data fed into the model. Active agents are taught by reinforcement learning to identify optimal actions given the current environment based on learned passed experience. They might keep learning with sensors or inputs Supervised v. Unsupervised Learning \u00b6 The informative algorithms are of these two types. Supervised Learning refers to scenarios where each data instance has a label. This label is used to train the algorithm so the labels can be predicted in the future. however Unsupervised Learning refers to scenarios where data does not have labels and the goal is just learning. Regression v. Classification \u00b6 In Regression the target is a real-numbered Quantitative value, like trying to predict the market value of a home given its square footage. Classification means the target is Qualitive a class like predicting if a borrower is a good credit risk or not. Machine Learning v. Traditional Algo \u00b6 Instead of processing input data with an algorithm, we train an algorithm that outputs a model to handle the problem. Some reasons for this are: There are complex problems that humans may be able to solve, but we couldn\u2019t just program a computer to solve them. Instead we let the computer process all the fine details The problem\u2019s scale could be massive! Just letting a computer do the job saves man hours Terminology \u00b6 There are a lot of terms for the same thing in machine learning.
