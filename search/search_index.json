This works hand in hand with dimensionality reduction. I have more on the subject here. kNN and K-means algorithms were both good tools to improve the performance of our previous models.<ul> <li>Using similarties to improve regression</li> <li>Using similarities to improve classification</li> <li>Clustering Spotify genres</li> <li>Failed dimensionality reduction of Spotify</li> </ul> </li> <li>Support Vector Machines: SVM\u2019s divide data in such a way that optimizes the margin between data. While we can perhaps visualize data being split by a line for classification, this method can not only be used for high dimensional classification but regression as well. I have a much better description here.<ul> <li>Classifciaton with SVMs</li> <li>Regression with SVMs</li> </ul> </li> <li>Neural Networks: While I explore neural networks in full in my future Natural Language Processing class, we still got some experience with how neural networks work with keras and tensorflow.

However, it came out more on a study on how you can\u2019t squeeze data to work your use case.
