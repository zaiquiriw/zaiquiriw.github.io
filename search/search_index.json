You can compare values to this to find outliers and such.</li> <li>Median: The center value of the data as it is in sorted order. This tells you a central tendency independent of skewed data or large outliers</li> <li>Range: is the minimum and maximum values the values of the dataset might take.

Given more and more powerful generalization tools, or methods of analyzation, we can grow more and more confident in the understanding of our data.</p> <p>If we can see a general trend using our descriptive statistical measurements, then we can assure our model will be able to eventually get the specific trend data we hope to predict from that dataset.</p>"}, {"location": "ML%20Work/data%20exploration/#covariance-and-correlation", "title": "Covariance and Correlation", "text": "<p>Given two attributes that may or may not be related, we may find the covariance and correlation between those two bits of data.
