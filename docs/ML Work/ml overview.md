# Machine Learning Work
Back in 2022 I took an introduction to Machine Learning with the wonderful [Karen Mazidi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mazidiaiconsulting/) who gave us a large overview of both data science basics, and basic machine learning. The class was project based, with a focus on providing documentation of the process.

## My Projects
While I will leave my original code open source on [github](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-portfolio/tree/main) the following markdown documents are reformatted for easier consumption
### Data Exploration in C++
This project is a reminder that I must understand these algorithms on the low level, so we both reviewed the statistical basics and implementing covariance and correlation calculation in C++.


### Linear Models
### Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
### Similarities
### SVM and Ensemble Study
### Sklearn
### Image Classification in Keras


## Learning in R
We covered using R for a variety of algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- kNN
- k-means Clustering
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines

As well as best practices for picking good attributes for analysis, cleaning up data in CSVs, and visualizing the results

## Learning in Python
We then pivoted to implementing these solutions in the Python package ecosystem, using:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Seaborn

To implement all the algorithms we just learned. Python allowed us to branch into Neural Networks using *Keras* for the implementation of zero-shot classification

>We even touched on Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian nets, but not much on their implementation

## Continued Work
This class carried into my work in NLP, which happened to coincide with the emergence of Open-AI's ChatGPT. [[nlp overview|Check it out]] for work on more advanced neural nets
