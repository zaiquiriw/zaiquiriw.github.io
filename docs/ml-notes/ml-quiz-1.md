## Q&A
> Q: Reinforcement learning is a form of supervised learning: 
> A: *False!*

> Q: Reinforcement learning is a form of unsupervised learning: 
> A: *False*
Unsupervised learning is informative while reinforcement learning is Active! **p24**

> Q: This term refers to a type of machine learning in which the target is a quantitative variable: 
> A: *regression*!
"Like trying to predict the market value of a home given its square footage and other data" **p25**
<!--ID: 1661553050777-->


> Q: This term refers to a type of machine learning in which the target is a qualitative variable: 
> A: *classification*!
"Predicting if a borrower is a good credit risk or not, given their income" etc. **p25**
<!--ID: 1661553050780-->


> Q: Clustering is an example of this type of machine learning: 
> A: *Unsupervised Learning*
"One learning scenario, clustering, seeks to group like instances. Another learning scenario, supervised learning..." **p22** (Meaning it is not supervised)
<!--ID: 1661553050782-->


> Q: In this type of learning, one column is the target and all other columns are predictors: 
> A: *Supervised*
"supervised learning refers to scenarios where each data instance has a label. This label is used to train the algorithm so that labels can be predicted for future data items." **p25**. In both Regression and Classification, the target is called, well a target, so it's safe to bet their superset is the answer

> Q: Another term for a qualitative column is a factor or ___ data:
> A: *categorical*
"Qualitative features are also called factors or categorical data" **p26**
<!--ID: 1661553050788-->


> Q: A column can be called a feature or a(n):
> A: *attribute*
"Each column in the table is an attribute, also called a feature or predictor" **p26**
<!--ID: 1661553050791-->


> Q: Another term for a row in a data set is a(n):
> A: *observation*
"Each row is a sample data point, also called an example, instance, or observation" **p26**
<!--ID: 1661553050793-->


> Q: Another term for a target is a(n):
> A: *response*
"If we want to learn GPA as a function of the other 3 features, we say that GPA is our target" **p26**
