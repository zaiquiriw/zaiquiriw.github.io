# Portfolio Cleanup
Like dusting off books on a shelf, there is knowledge waiting to be shared

## MKDocs and Obsidian Markdown
I'm using Mara Li's excellent [Obsidian Publish](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher) plugin to push notes from my obsidian vault to a github pages repo. I had tried this before, but only in testing. Now it is time to take existing data science projects I have and push to this static site. This means I just ripped the pre-existing notes off the website and restarted! Spring cleaning feels great

## What am I making?
The only real decision is structure, of which there are a couple things to note:
- Obsidian Notes (like this basic one!) can be pushed to an obsidian sub directory to act as an archive
- The ML and NLP portfolios can have their own folders, with home pages for each section to act as summaries built from what I have already written
- The homepage of the size can just be an introduction to me, and service as the about page.

## Aesthetics
For now! There shouldn't be any!
